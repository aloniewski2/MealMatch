# MealMatch
MealMatch is a full-stack recipe finder that merges TheMealDB and Spoonacular results, scores them by how closely they match your pantry, and augments the details with USDA nutrition data. Search by ingredients, filter by cuisine or diet, use the pantry manager to auto-fill inputs, and save favorites, shopping lists, and pantry items synced.
